def process_data(data):
    try:
        validate_data(data)
        transform_data(data)
    except Exception as e:
        log_error(e)

# 0.01% LEVEL
class LakehousePipeline:
    def __init__(self):
        self.delta_table = DeltaTable(path)
        self.mlflow_client = MlflowClient()
    
    def process_data(self, data):
        with self.delta_table.optimized_write():
            self.validate_schema()
            self.handle_schema_evolution()
            self.merge_with_history()
            self.log_metrics()
```

### **2. Architectural Mastery**
```sql
-- FOUNDATION LEVEL
SELECT 
    user_id,
    COUNT(*) as event_count
FROM events
GROUP BY user_id;

-- 0.01% LEVEL
WITH user_metrics AS (
    SELECT 
        user_id,
        COUNT(*) OVER(
            PARTITION BY user_id 
            ORDER BY event_time 
            RANGE BETWEEN INTERVAL '7' DAY PRECEDING 
            AND CURRENT ROW
        ) as rolling_7day_events
    FROM events
    WHERE _delta_version > @last_processed_version
),
feature_store AS (
    SELECT 
        um.*,
        dp.predictions,
        RANK() OVER(
            PARTITION BY um.user_id 
            ORDER BY dp.prediction_time DESC
        ) as pred_rank
    FROM user_metrics um
    LEFT JOIN ml.prediction_history dp 
    ON um.user_id = dp.user_id
)
SELECT * FROM feature_store WHERE pred_rank = 1;
```
