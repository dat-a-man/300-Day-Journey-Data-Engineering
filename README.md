I made this repo for myself: a clear, structured plan to climb into the top 1% of data engineers. But hey, good things shouldn’t stay hidden, so I’m making it public. If you want to learn data engineering deeply and systematically, you might find this approach helpful. Honestly, it should be better than 99.9% of the courses out there.
